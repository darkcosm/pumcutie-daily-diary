### Brain Dump Space

- **Encourages mindful, focused use** rather than quick phone checking
- **Better for kids** - promotes healthy screen boundaries  
- **Supports executive function** with more screen space for organization

- **Better accessibility** for fine motor challenges
- **Natural routine building** - sitting down for daily check-ins

## 🛠️ For Developers

- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - no frameworks, no build process
- **IndexedDB** for local data storage with fallbacks (with JSON export/import)
- **CSS Custom Properties** for theme system
- **Single-file architecture** for maximum accessibility

### Contributing
Contributions welcome! Please:

## 💌 A Note to Users

This diary isn't about becoming more productive or fixing yourself. You're already enough, exactly as you are. This is just a gentle tool to help you notice and appreciate your daily experience.

Some days you'll use every feature. Some days you'll just click "I did enough today." Both are perfectly valid.
